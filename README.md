App Name: Hey Teacher!

Description: This app helps teachers learn what is going on in their students minds...well sort of. With this, students can anonymously say they don't understand a topic their teacher is explaining, and the teacher can get data
about how many students do not understand their topics.

How it works (basic): Students click join class from the main window that leads them to the students main menu. Here they type in their class number that the teacher announces and they are connected to the class. They press the "I do not understand" (IDU) button this sends sends it to the teacher. The teacher clicks on create class, they then proceed to enter in their class name, the number of students, a warning threshold and a button timeout. The button timeout is for the graph on the next screen that grabs the number of IDUs after a certain amount of time. The timeout is also to stop students from pressing the button too many times. The threshold is for the number of students then the teacher will be alerted. The teacher view has a running graph of the number of students, a class Id, a reset button (resets the number of confused students to and the students timer to 0), and a end class which closes out everything and clears everything.
